You will be able to view your recordings, as well as send actions to a frontend of your choosing.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n# Install NodeJS\r\n  Either follow instructions to install from source, or install from http://nodejs.org.\r\n# Install npm\r\n    curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | sudo sh\r\n# Install dependencies\r\n    sudo apt-get install libavahi-compat-libdnssd-dev\r\n# Within the ReMyth directory\r\n    npm install\r\n# Hack mdns\r\n  The dependency mdns expects all service names to be 14 characters or less.  Since MythTV's service names are longer than 14 characters this isn't going to work.\r\n  \r\n  Edit file node_modules/mdns/lib/service_type.js.  In this file there are 2 spots that check for a length of 14 or less.  Comment out those checks.  I have not found this to harm the application in any way.\r\n# Run \"node spawn.js\"\r\n\r\nMore coming soon!  Please report any issues that you have with this application to me.  Also, if you are into development feel free to submit patches to me.","name":"ReMyth","google":""}
